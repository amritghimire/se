# Avoid abbreviating variable names.
# Write out your function argument names.
# Document your classes and methods.
# Comment your code.
# Refactor repeated lines of code into reusable functions or methods.
# Keep functions and methods short. A good rule of thumb is that scrolling should not be necessary to read an entire function or method.
